  <h1>About Our Project</h1>

  <h2>Details About Data</h2>
  <p>
    Using a CSV file we will aquire all furniture items Names, Variations, Patterns, Prices and
    if the item is craftable (DIY) from the video game Animal Crossing New Horizons. The user
    will have the ability to store said furniture items in a "Player Home". The specifics about said home
    including the homes size and value will be aquired using Faker. The Player will also have data pulled from Faker
    including Username, Gender, Email, Birthday and Bells (In game Currency).
